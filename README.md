The purpose of this thesis paper is to discuss the affect of failing infrastructure on socio-economic and socio-ecological groups in a rural area due to a natural disaster.
I will be using the events in western North Carolina after Hurricane Helene to base the majority of my paper on.
The beginning of the paper will discuss the events that occured, why the infrastructure was subpar, and how the failures occurred.
The paper will then discuss that affects that were felt on the socio-economic and socio-ecological level at the point in time of the event.
The end of the paper will discuss future research to be completed to determine the long term effects and the systems that need to be updated/put in place to prevent this from occurring again in the future.
